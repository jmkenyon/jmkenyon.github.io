            <p>Meditation is the practice of focusing your attention on an object, which is often your breath in mindful meditation practices. It is sometimes incorrectly believed to be the practice of completely clearing your mind of thoughts. That is, however, not the aim of meditation. Meditation is the practice of observing the thoughts, feelings, and sensations that arise in your consciousness, accepting them, and then returning your focus to the breath.</p>
            
            <p>You may have meditation sessions where you are nothing but distracted. And perhaps the only time you return to the breath is when you are reminded to do so by the meditation guide that you have playing on your phone. That is fine. Try not to be annoyed when you get distracted as that is the antithesis of what you are trying to achieve. You should accept all distractions as a function of your consciousness and then return to your point of focus.</p>
            
            <p class="bold blog_heading">Benefits of meditation</p>
            
            <p>The quality of your life is entirely linked to how connected you are to the present moment. In meditation, you realise that the present moment is sufficient so that you are no longer seeking happiness in the future. Life and career goals can often carry with them an expectation that you will become happy after achieving those goals.  But that is an illusion. You will continually search for the next goal without ever being content in the present. Meditation refocuses your attention back to finding fulfilment in the present moment.</p>

            <p>Meditation teaches you to accept thoughts and emotions as they arise. Emotions themselves are just bodily sensations. The feeling of excitement before going on a roller coaster and nervousness before going to a job interview is almost identical other than the story that you tell yourself in those scenarios. You cannot change the emotions that arise, but you can intervene to stop yourself from constantly thinking about all the things that are causing you to feel that way. Understanding that allows you to dissociate and not be consumed by those emotions.</p>

            <p>Your emotions and thoughts are not you. We have no control over how we are currently feeling or what thoughts arise in our minds. You do not know what your next thought will be in the same way that you do not know what my next sentence will say. Meditation is the practice of watching those thoughts and feelings arise in your consciousness and then letting go of them. Learning to let go of negative thoughts and feelings is especially useful in living a happy life.</p>
            
            <p class="bold blog_heading">Next steps</p>
            
            <p>Start small. Try to do five or ten minutes for the first time. It is fine if you find it hard to concentrate, just keep going. Sometimes you will have a great session that feels bliss, sometimes you wonâ€™t. Simply notice any thoughts, feelings, and sensations as they arise and then turn your attention back to your point of focus.</p>
