            <p>According to the 2019 world happiness report, negative emotions such as worry, sadness, and anger have been <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/world_happiness_report_finds_that_people_are_feeling_worse" target="_blank"> rising</a> around the world. How is it possible that we are getting unhappier in the face of the rising living standards catalysed by improvements to technology? Though perhaps it is because of – rather than despite – better technology that we are feeling this way. The smartphone, for example, has substantially diminished the necessity for social interactions. We are, however, a social species dependent on these interactions for the maintenance of our well-being. With that in mind, we should aim to reduce the time we spend using our phones and spend more time communicating with those around us.</p>
                        
            <p class="bold blog_heading">Are you addicted to your phone?</p>
            
            <p>The recent improvements in technology have allowed us to live longer, eat better, and travel further. There is, however, a dark side to technology: addictive phones. Social media applications such as TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook are designed to keep users scrolling aimlessly. The average smartphone user will unlock their phone <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/1/6/21048116/tech-companies-time-well-spent-mobile-phone-usage-data" target="_blank"> 58</a> times a day and spend three and a half hours looking at the screen. In three and a half hours, someone could start learning a new skill, read a book, or go to the gym. There is no short- or long-term benefit of aimlessly scrolling through social media. Not many people are left with a sense of accomplishment after a three-hour binge of TikTok. Given how temporary this existence is, you have a responsibility to not waste so much time.</p>

            <p>Applications such as Instagram have often been accused of damaging mental health by promoting unrealistic body expectations and facilitating cyberbullying. But more pertinently, these are applications where people carefully select their most attractive and joyful photos to post. If you compare that to your own life, as someone who goes through the normal vicissitudes of existence, you could be led to believe that your life is inadequate. But that is not the case. No one is as happy or as attractive as they seem on social media. An adjustment must be made when utilising these applications to understand that they are not displaying an accurate representation of people’s lives.</p>

            <p class="bold blog_heading">From caveman to cyborg</p>

            <p>We now live in a world that we did not evolve for. The reason so many of us are addicted to chocolate is that sugar was a <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-does-sugar-taste-so-good/" target="_blank"> rare</a> nutrient in the earlier days of our evolution. It was therefore advantageous to consume as much as possible on its discovery. Those that liked the taste of sugar were more likely to procreate and pass on those sugar-loving genes to the next generation. Today, partly as a result of that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/mar/20/sugar-deadly-obesity-epidemic" target="_blank"> mechanism</a>, 28% of adults in the UK are <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn03336/#:~:text=The%20Health%20Survey%20for%20England,are%20overweight%20but%20not%20obese.&text=The%20survey%20found%20that%20men,to%20be%20overweight%20or%20obese." target="_blank"> obese</a>. Parrels can be drawn to the fact that we did not evolve to have a device in our pocket with direct access to food delivery, potential dating partners, and everyone’s <i>expert</i> opinions on Twitter. Today, <a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/statistics-and-facts-about-mental-health/how-common-are-mental-health-problems/" target="_blank"> one in four</a> people suffer from some form of mental health issue in England each year. Though perhaps our well-being is better suited to a world without technology, there is no turning back.</p>
            
            <p>Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, claims that humans are already <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/2/11837854/neural-lace-cyborgs-elon-musk" target="_blank"> cyborgs</a>. We can now answer any question immediately, send messages to millions of people, and video call anyone around the world. The downside of becoming so connected to our phone, however, is that having to go a couple of days without it makes people feel as though they have lost a part of themselves. Everyone reading this will know how it feels to have temporarily misplaced their phone. The fact we are so emotionally dependant on having this device in our pockets should be daunting and we should try to weaken, or even break, that dependency.</p>

            <p>It is crucial to offset the declining social interactions caused by smartphones by communicating more with those around us. Do you try to start a conversation with your Uber driver? The cashier at the supermarket? The person you are standing next to in an elevator? Perhaps you should. One study found that people felt <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550613502990" target="_blank"> happier</a> after having a conversation with the barista when ordering a coffee. Though not a panacea, these small interactions could go a long way in improving our well-being. Society is now becoming increasingly structured in a way that reduces in-person interactions. Many of us, for example, are going to be working from home for the foreseeable future. We should try to fight this trend in our daily lives by limiting our screen time and actively engaging with the world around us.</p>
